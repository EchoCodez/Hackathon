    <h1>About</h1>
    <p>
      We are three middle schoolers from Ashburn, Virginia with a passion for
      coding. We have always made it a point to give back to the community we
      grew up in, and Cipher Santa is an incredible way to do just that. We hope
      to extend this concept year-round, rather than just during the holidays,
      to make the most impact we can.
    </p>

      Our website, Cipher Santa, allows citizens who want to donate this holiday
      season to connect with local homeless shelters to give a present to a
      person in need. While anyone can do this remotely, our website allows for
      the gift to be more personal with an option to customize a wishlist,
      budget, and location-specific shelter. This allows people in homeless
      shelters to have a fun, personalized, secret-santa based game, or as we
      call it: a "cipher santa". When you log onto our site, you can access two
      links, based on your need. If you want to donate to a homeless shelter
      near you, click the button saying "I want to donate". If you are a
      homeless shelter coordinator, click the link called "I am seeking
      donations", to sign up as many people in your homeless shelter who want to
      receive a present from their cipher santa. If you are a donor, our server
      will then connect you with a person in need, and will provide a wish list
      of things that the person may want, and donors can buy a present according
      to that person's wishlist.
