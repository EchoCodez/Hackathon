      There are many people who cannot afford to buy Christmas presents to share with their loved ones each year. Our website allows amazing citizens to connect with  local homeless shelters to find a person in need. Donors can select the donation form and fill out the required information. Our server will connect you with a person in need, and donors can buy a present according to that personâ€™s wishlist, which will be sent to the homeless shelter that they are connected to. Cipher Santa is for anyone that wants to make a difference in their community, big or small.
